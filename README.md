#DockerDev
My simple docker image that I use to sandbox development projects

#Login
If you are not me, which if you are reading this I will assume you aren't,
then my .ssh file will not help you. To accomodate people who are not me,
I have created user `wblankenship` with password `password` so that you can
enjoy my container as if you were me.

Cheers!
